# minicpp
An attempt at a rewrite of the c++ std library to reduce bloat and improve ergonomics

## DISCLAIMER
This uses llvm's libcxx code for implementation. I wasnt sure of the best way to fork it so made a new repo but please just know a lot of the way stuff is handled is very much based around code taken from libcxx albeit with a lot of modifications. Please contact me if you have a better way to fork it while still having atribution
